## NuReddit  


This application is meant to be a fork of Reddits, meant to work on mobile devices and desktop and provide a minimal user compared to the vanilla 
Reddit, being able to browse any subreddit, and read and post comments as well. 


Installation: 

This web app requires no installation to your local environment.


Configuration: 


In order for this application to work as expected, be sure you are on an Chromium based brower (Edge, Chrome, Brave, etc.) in order to
get the best experience of what this application delivers. Having this work on other browers such as Firefox will take some additional time.
